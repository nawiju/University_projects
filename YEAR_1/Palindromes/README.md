This program allows players to play the game Palindrome, a variant of the Connect Four game played by two players. The players take turns placing their token on a rectangular board, choosing a column and putting their token in the first available space, counting from the bottom of the board. A player wins by creating a palindrome of a specified length with consecutive tokens in the same row, column, or diagonal. This program facilitates playing the game on the terminal by two people. The program assumes that the input is correct.
