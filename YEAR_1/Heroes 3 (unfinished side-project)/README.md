## Heroes 3 side project

Language: Java

Class: Programowanie Obiektowe (Object-Oriented Programming)

A side-project that aims to implement some of the functionality of the Heroes 3 video game. The project implements a set of players, units and actions the units can perform. This project is unfinished due to the lack of time however I grasped a better understanding of object-oriented programming through the process of creating it.
