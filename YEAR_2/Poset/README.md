## Poset Library 
Language: C++

Class: Kurs programowania w C++ (Programming in C++)

This is a module implemented in C++ that handles operations on partially ordered sets (posets) of strings. This module is intended to be used in C and C++ and provides functions to create, delete, query, and modify posets. The implementation uses the C++ standard library containers (e.g., unordered_map) and facilitates the interaction between C and C++. The provided functions include creating a new poset, deleting a poset, obtaining the size of a poset, inserting and removing elements, adding and deleting relations between elements, testing relations, and clearing a poset. The functions print diagnostic information to the standard error stream (or do not print diagnostic messages if compiled with the -NDEBUG flag).

Note: I wrote this project together with Anna Pi√≥rkowska.
